## What is it ?

When you regulary switch languages / frameworks to other, it's hard to remember the specificity of each one of them. This repo is a personal place where I put notes about my learning experience. It's a mix between documentation, cheatsheet and good practice highlights.

## Can I use it or contribute ?

Of course, that's why I opened it to the public. If you think something is wrong or could be improve, please point it out with an issue.
